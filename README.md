# Heavenly Delights

Forked from Kitcheneesta an Android application that allows the Kitcheneesta bakery customers to remotely customise and order cakes for delivery via a simple and clean user interface. 

This project helped me gain familiarity with designing user interfaces, and
implementing complex layouts, list adapters and GridViews.
